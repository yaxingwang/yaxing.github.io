The emergence of large-scale text-to-image generative models represents a groundbreaking advancement in the evolution of generative AI. These models can synthesize a wide range of images encompassing highly complex visual concepts.As a result, substantial endeavors have been dedicated to editing real images through the utilization of these pre-trained diffusion models.  However, these methods encounter two challenges.  Users are required to provide accurate text descriptions in the input image.  The existing methods still fail to accurately process the given image, resulting in low-quality images, and the editing outcomes are unsatisfactory. To address this issue, we propose a new approach. We employ the SDS loss function to update the target image. Simultaneously, we extract the attention map to constrain the image updates. Our method exhibits superior editing capabilities compared to existing and contemporary works, as evidenced by comprehensive experimental results on diverse images and prompt editing. The evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, supports the effectiveness of our approach.
